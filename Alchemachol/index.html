"Do you ever think about all of the little men (and waman) who live inside of your kidneys and, like, punch at the walls and whether or not they be fuckin in there? I do, because I’m not like other rat men lady, thingies. I also can tell that people are stressed because I’m too sexy and it has nothing to do with war or whatever. I know this because I’m an empath. I think that incels could be sexy, like, if they weren’t incels. Ya’know? Anyway I know this one sexy son of a bitch. It’s kind of like me, but if me were more fertile. Ya’know. Of course you don’t I’m just a hotdog dipped in chow chow and put in a microwave until it catches fire. Not in a gender way of course. Right now my gender is like if you sipped vodka from a wine glass and decided to type whatever comes into your head."
